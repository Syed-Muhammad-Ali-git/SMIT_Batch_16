Note: JavaScript Exam:

Create a simple banking system using a Map to store account information. The system should have the following features:

Account Creation: Create a new account with a unique account number, account holder's name, and an initial balance.
Deposit: Deposit a certain amount into an existing account.
Withdrawal: Withdraw a certain amount from an existing account.
Balance Inquiry: Display the current balance of an account.
Account Deletion: Delete an existing account.
Requirements:

Use a Map to store account information, where the key is the account number and the value is an object containing the account holder's name and balance.
Implement the above features using methods on the Map.
Use JavaScript's built-in Map class to create the map.
Use console.log statements to display the results of each operation.
Example Use Cases:

Create an account with account number 12345, account holder's name "John Doe", and an initial balance of 1000.
Deposit 500 into account 12345.
Withdraw 200 from account 12345.
Display the current balance of account 12345.
Delete account 12345.
Deliverables:

A single JavaScript file containing the implementation of the banking system using a Map.
A brief explanation of how the code works and how the Map is used to store and retrieve account information.
Grading Criteria:

Correctness: Does the code implement the required features correctly?
Code Quality: Is the code well-organized, readable, and maintainable?
Use of Map: Is the Map used effectively to store and retrieve account information?
I hope this assignment helps you practice using the new Map in JavaScript!
